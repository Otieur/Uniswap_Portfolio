## My role
Product Lead and UX Researcher. Led multi-phase research and translated findings into a high-fidelity Figma prototype and prioritized UX changes.

## Design deliverables
- User flows in Figma for three core journeys: sign up and verification, complete transaction, post an item for exchange.
- High-fidelity interactive prototype designed for clarity, trust, and accessibility across the end-to-end exchange workflow.

## Research and testing
- User requirements research: questionnaire (n=29) and interviews across target groups, plus low-fidelity prototypes to refine concepts.
- Usability study: moderated think-aloud task sessions (n=6) across the three flows; captured task success, time, errors, post-task ratings, and qualitative feedback.

## Key findings and iterations
- Identified friction points such as unclear transaction status visibility, confusing pickup confirmation, and dense item posting layout.
- Iterated the prototype with clearer field grouping, improved navigation consistency, and more visible status and review entry points.

## Web application
Built the UniSwap web-based UI in React and iterated the front end based on research findings and usability feedback.
